Hi AnimChallenger!

This rig was created by:
Original 3D model from scifi3d.com
Emilio Serrano [Rigging] | Gumroad: https://milio-serrano.gumroad.com/

Rigged with Advanced Skeleton and is compatible with all Maya versions.

The geometry is by default subdivided. For faster viewport interaction set the subdivision level to 0 by selecting the "Main" control and in channel box "Mesh Res" set the value to 0 (off) 1 (on).
